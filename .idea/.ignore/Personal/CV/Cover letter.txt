Hello,
I'm Moamen Mamdouh, a Senior testing engineer working currently at VOIS (Vodafone Intelligent Solutions).
I have been in software field for more than 4 years,  and I believe that I had a noticable impact in all positions I occupied throughout my career.
I'm currently working in telecommunication industry as a part of IVR squad at VOIS acting as squad testing SPOC with two junior testing engineers, and also supporting TOBi's chatbot squad.
We are working in a SAfe agile environment, and my role includes creating test plans, preparing test  data, executing test cases on multiple available environments.
I'm working on our test automation framework as well, creating test scripts for new features, maintaining regression suites for existing features and supporting junior engineers in case of need.
Before that I was working as a QA engineer at noon, mainly working on seller applications including seller lab, onboarding application, and pre orders application.
I was part of testing hiring team, and I conducted many knowledge transfer sessions to stakeholders beside the regular QA engineer tasks.
I gained knowledge in E-commerce field and worked in an agile kanban team.
I'm a quick learner, flexible, and extremely adaptable based on business needs with high effeciency in minimum time to provide the optimum benefit for users.
I look to this vacancy at CAFU as a great opportunity to add to my experience, and to provide value with all the things that I gained throughout my whole software journey.
I didn't speak much about my technical skills as I know they are already mentioned in my CV, so I tried to let you know a little bit about my career that you might not able to see on my CV.
Looking forward to talk to you more and good luck.
Best Regards.
